# Introduction

This repository contains solution to coding challenge recommendation-system.


# Approach

1. This recommendation system uses data from IMDB/MovieLens dataset.
2. Some concepts used here are - PageRank, Content-Based Recommendation, Collaborative Filtering.
3. Machine learning terminology you'll come across here - One-Hot Encoding, Cross-Validation, R-squared metric.
4. The notebook uses and compares Linear Regression and Decision Trees models to predict movie ratings for users.
5. The ML pipeline used here - data wrangling->exploratory data analysis->feature engineering->baseline model->best model.


# Dependencies
Python libraries: re, ast, time, heapq, decimal, operator, subprocess, numpy, scipy, pandas, seaborn, networkx, rpy2, itertools, matplotlib, datetime, collections, networkx, sklearn, surprise
R libraries: doMC, Kmisc, igraph, data.table


# Running the Code
1. Jupyter notebook recommendationSystem.ipynb (Python kernel) is the master file.
2. It makes use of:
  - wd_um_graph.txt generated by weightedDirectedUserGraph.ipynb (R kernel)
  - wu_movie_graph.txt generated by weightedUndirectedMovieGraph.ipynb (R kernel)
3. The repository directory structure given below must be maintained for the code to run successfully.
