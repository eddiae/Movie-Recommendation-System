    "The weighted undirected G(V,E) has edges between movies that denote the users that rated both the movies out of all the users combined that rated either of these movies. This measure of similarity/dissimilarity is called Jaccard index. Hence, higher value of this index would indicate that the two movies have been rated by pretty much the same set of users with respect to the pool of users that have rated either of these movies. However, we can't infer anything about how well a movie would do since the graph doesn't take into account the rating to them by the users. However, by performing community detection, we can identify movies that have been rated by similar set of users on the basis of their genres. So, this would give us the most popular genres in that community."
