    "The weighted directed G(V,E) has edges between users that denote the proportion of movies that the two users have rated in common with respect to the total number of movies they have rated by themselves. Hence, higher edge weight indicates that the users have rated pretty much the same subset of movies. However, we can't infer anything about the preferences of the users from here since the graph doesn't take into account the rating given by them to the movies that they've reviewed. So, we look for users with more number of overlaps with its neighbours and can be categorised as \"active\" i.e. having higher PageRank."
